Abiotic Factor Save Editor
==========

AFSE is a tool that allows for editing coordinates in Abiotic Factor save files. It is intended to be used for practicing tricks for speedrunning, or for testing skips by editing coordinates to easily place the player out of bounds.

Features

  * Editing player position in save files
  * Saving a position that can be quickly restored for practicing tricks

Download the latest release and run it anywhere. The program will automatically find your save directory.

Technical Information

#### How It Works
The game saves your "Last Safe World Location" to a file every time you save and exit to menu. AFSE edits this location in your save file and the game automatically restores this position when your save is loaded.
